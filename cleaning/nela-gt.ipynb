So to understand how it’s going to play out, the past is really our best guide. “I think we’re just all in for a really crazy ride.” Collectively, these New York Times reporters have covered U.S. politics for over 150 years. “I’m also a drummer in a band, so …” They’ve reported on past impeachment inquiries. “Yea, I’m lost in Senate wonderland.” And they say that the three we’ve had so far have been full of twists and turns. “The president of the United States is not guilty as charged.” In short, expect the unexpected. First, the process. Impeachment is technically only the initial stage. “Common misconceptions about impeachment are that impeachment by itself means removal from office. It doesn’t. The impeachment part of the process is only the indictment that sets up a trial.” The Constitution describes offenses that are grounds for removing the president from office as bribery, treason and — “They say high crimes and misdemeanors, which, really, is in the eye of the beholder.” “The framers didn’t give us a guidebook to it. They simply said, that the House had the responsibility for impeachment and the Senate had the responsibility for the trial.” One of the things missing from the Constitution? How an impeachment inquiry should start. And that has generally been a source of drama. Basically, anything goes. “In fact, in the Andrew Johnson case they voted to impeach him without even having drafted the articles of impeachment.” For Richard Nixon, his case started with several investigations that led to public hearings. That part of the process went on for two years, and yielded revelation after revelation, connecting Nixon to a politically-motivated burglary at D.N.C. headquarters — “… located in the Watergate office building.” — and its subsequent cover-up. “Mr. Butterfield, are you aware of the installation of any listening devices in the Oval Office of the president?” “I was aware of listening devices. Yes, sir.” “This was a shocker. Everybody in the White House recognized how damaging this could be.” As the House drafted articles of impeachment, Nixon lost the support of his party. “O.K., I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.” “I was asked to write the farewell piece that ran the morning after Nixon resigned. And this is what I wrote: The central question is how a man who won so much could have lost so much.” So for Nixon, it more or less ended after the investigations. But for Bill Clinton, that phase was just the beginning. “This is the information.” An independent counsel’s investigation into his business dealings unexpectedly turned into a very public inquiry about his personal life. “The idea that a president of the United States was having an affair with a White House intern and then a federal prosecutor was looking at that, it was just extraordinary.” That investigation led to public hearings in the House Judiciary Committee. “When the Starr Report was being delivered to Congress it was a little bit like the O.J. chase, only a political one. There were two black cars. They were being filmed live on CNN. They were heading towards the Capitol. We were watching it and a little bit agog.” Public opinion is key. And the media plays a huge part in the process. This was definitely true for Clinton. “You know it was just a crazy time. We worked in the Senate press gallery.” “All your colleagues are kind of piled on top of each other.” “We had crummy computers, the fax machine would always break. The printer would always break.” After committee hearings, the House brought formal impeachment charges. “It was very tense. I thought that the Saturday of the impeachment vote in the House was one of the most tense days I’d experienced in Washington.” And it turned out, also, full of surprises. “The day of impeachment arrived, everyone’s making very impassioned speeches about whether Bill Clinton should or should not be impeached and Livingston rises to give an argument for the House Republicans. He started to talk about how Clinton could resign.” “You, sir, may resign your post.” “And all of a sudden people start booing and saying, ‘Resign, resign’!” “So I must set the example.” “He announced he was resigning because he had had extramarital affairs and challenged President Clinton to do the only honorable thing, in his view —” “I hope President Clinton will follow.” “— to resign as well, so there was all this drama unfolding even in the midst of impeachment.” Then it went to the Senate for trial. The Constitution gets a little more specific about this part. “The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is supposed to preside over that trial.” “Rehnquist, he showed up in this robe he had made for himself, which had gold stripes on the sleeves because he liked Gilbert and Sullivan.” “The Senate is the actual jury.” “You will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws. So help you, God.” “This is a copy of the rules of the Senate for handling impeachment. They’re actually very specific.” “Meet six days a week.” “Convene at noon. The senators have to sit at their desks and remain quiet in their role as jurors. And not talk, which trust me, is going to be a problem for some of the senators who are used to talking all the time.” It’s just like a courtroom trial. There are prosecutors who present the case against the president. “That was perjury.” Only, they’re members of the House, and they’re called managers. Then the senators, or the jurors, vote. And things are still, unpredictable. “The options are guilty or not guilty. But there was one senator —” “Arlen Specter, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania.” “Under Scottish law, there are three possible verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proved.” “— which is not a thing.” “And everybody just looks, you know, how do you even record that vote?” In the end, there were not enough votes to oust Clinton. “What’s amazing about this whole thing to me wasn’t so much the constitutional process. It was that it felt to me like the beginning of really intense partisanship, the weaponization of partisanship.” And here’s the thing: An impeachment charge has never gotten the two-thirds majority it needs in the Senate to actually oust a president from office. “So you could end up having a situation where the president is impeached, acquitted and runs for re-election and wins re-election.” And that would be a first. “This is my ticket to the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. I don’t think you’ll find these on StubHub.”","count":13},{"name":"5619 others","count":6405}]}},{"name":"author","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":1588,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"","count":307},{"name":"Maggie Astor","count":81},{"name":"1586 others","count":6122}]}},{"name":"url","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":4963,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/business/economy/june-jobs-report.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","count":5},{"name":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-national-emergency.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","count":5},{"name":"4961 others","count":6500}]}},{"name":"published","dtype":"object","stats":{"unique_count":6343,"nan_count":0,"categories":[{"name":"2019-08-29 08:14:38+00:00","count":4},{"name":"2019-01-17 16:05:29+00:00","count":3},{"name":"6341 others","count":6503}]}},{"name":"published_utc","dtype":"int64","stats":{"unique_count":6332,"nan_count":0,"min":1546318810,"max":1577764757,"histogram":[{"bin_start":1546318810,"bin_end":1549463404.7,"count":897},{"bin_start":1549463404.7,"bin_end":1552607999.4,"count":643},{"bin_start":1552607999.4,"bin_end":1555752594.1,"count":758},{"bin_start":1555752594.1,"bin_end":1558897188.8,"count":495},{"bin_start":1558897188.8,"bin_end":1562041783.5,"count":725},{"bin_start":1562041783.5,"bin_end":1565186378.2,"count":562},{"bin_start":1565186378.2,"bin_end":1568330972.9,"count":540},{"bin_start":1568330972.9,"bin_end":1571475567.6,"count":676},{"bin_start":1571475567.6,"bin_end":1574620162.3,"count":612},{"bin_start":1574620162.3,"bin_end":1577764757,"count":602}]}},{"name":"collection_utc","dtype":"int64","stats":{"unique_count":1258,"nan_count":0,"min":1567533369,"max":1577751305,"histogram":[{"bin_start":1567533369,"bin_end":1568555162.6,"count":4370},{"bin_start":1568555162.6,"bin_end":1569576956.2,"count":343},{"bin_start":1569576956.2,"bin_end":1570598749.8,"count":248},{"bin_start":1570598749.8,"bin_end":1571620543.4,"count":340},{"bin_start":1571620543.4,"bin_end":1572642337,"count":45},{"bin_start":1572642337,"bin_end":1573664130.6,"count":258},{"bin_start":1573664130.6,"bin_end":1574685924.2,"count":313},{"bin_start":1574685924.2,"bin_end":1575707717.8,"count":203},{"bin_start":1575707717.8,"bin_end":1576729511.4,"count":247},{"bin_start":1576729511.4,"bin_end":1577751305,"count":143}]}},{"name":"_deepnote_index_column","dtype":"int64"}],"rows_top":[{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-01-30--Fed Signals End of Interest Rate Increases","date":"2019-01-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Fed Signals End of Interest Rate Increases","content":"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve stepped hard on the brakes Wednesday, indicating for the first time in recent years that it did not anticipate any additional interest rate increases.\n\nIn a statement following a two-day meeting of its policymaking committee, the Fed said that economic growth remained “solid,” and that it expected growth to continue.\n\nBut in a sharp reversal of its stance just one month ago, the Fed did not say it expected to keep raising interest rates.

This is somewhat more like Mr. Perot, who capitalized on populist dissatisfaction in 1992. Perhaps a Schultz bid could even be thought of as the reverse of Mr. Perot’s bid: a revolt of pragmatic, centrist voters against newly resurgent populism.\n\nDissatisfied centrists are well represented in the American elite, but not across the American electorate. According to a Pew Research survey of more than 5,000 Americans in 2017, 78 percent of registered voters have a favorable view of at least one major party, and only 18 percent have an unfavorable view of both. Similarly, only 16 percent say both parties are “too extreme,” according to the survey.\n\nThese dissatisfied centrist voters fit the profile of affluent, socially moderate and fiscally conservative suburban voters. They are twice as likely to make more than $100,000 per year than voters who have a favorable view of a party, and 78 percent of these voters say Democrats “too often see government as the only way to solve problems.”\n\nLike Mr. Schultz, who built up Starbucks starting in Seattle, these affluent voters also tend to be men and are overrepresented in the West. On balance, it is a group with libertarian instincts and corporate sympathies.\n\nMr. Schultz could certainly play to these voters, but it is not a particularly electorally fruitful group. In an analysis of the Voter Study Group, Lee Drutman, a political scientist, found that just 4 percent of voters were conservative on economic issues and liberal on cultural issues. In comparison, populists represented 29 percent of the 2018 electorate. Mr. Schultz’s candidacy might be the reverse of Mr. Perot’s, but Mr. Perot’s pitch probably had broader appeal.\n\nDuring parts of the 1992 campaign, Mr. Perot also had the benefit of a president with an approval rating in the low 30s and upper 20s. In theory, that was low enough to create an opening for a centrist independent candidate who could win with as little as 35 percent of the vote if he drew evenly from both parties. In the end, Mr. Perot won 19 percent, though at times he held significantly more support in the polls.\n\nToday, President Trump’s approval rating is around 40 percent, and it was in the mid-40s among likely voters fairly recently. In the Pew study, 39 percent of voters who had an unfavorable opinion of both parties approved of Mr. Trump’s performance, about the same as among other registered voters. So long as that’s true, it would be hard for Mr. Schultz to find a path to victory.","author":"NATE COHN","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/upshot/could-howard-schultz-help-re-elect-the-president.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-01-30 15:35:42+00:00","published_utc":1548880542,"collection_utc":1567550256,"_deepnote_index_column":5},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-01-30--On Washington After a Shutdown Test of Wills Comes a Test of Governance","date":"2019-01-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"On Washington: After a Shutdown Test of Wills Comes a Test of Governance","content":"WASHINGTON — After four years of free Republican rein, President George W.

Mr. Trump is expected to meet with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, next month.\n\nMr. Trump announced in December a plan to withdraw American troops from Syria after concluding that “we have won” against the Islamic State. Prominent members of his own party have denounced what Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, on Tuesday called “a precipitous withdrawal” of American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.\n\nWhile it is unusual for a president to pick a fight with his intelligence chiefs, this is not the first time for Mr. Trump. After the 2016 election and before he took office in 2017, Mr. Trump was publicly skeptical of intelligence conclusions that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election, and he mocked intelligence agencies for their role in the lead-up to the Iraq war.\n\nMr. Trump also contradicted last year’s global threat assessment from senior intelligence officials, whom he had appointed to his administration. While his top intelligence officials warned about Russia’s continuing efforts to conduct influence operations, Mr. Trump continued to dismiss any notion that Russia had interfered in American elections.\n\nDouglas H. Wise, a career C.I.A. official and former top deputy at the Defense Intelligence Agency, said Mr. Trump’s criticism of the intelligence chiefs threatened to corrupt the process. Intelligence officers do not like to be at odds with the president, he said, and Mr. Trump’s comments put them in an uncomfortable position.\n\n“This is a consequence of narcissism but it is a strong and inappropriate public political pressure to get the intelligence community leadership aligned with his political goals,” Mr. Wise said. “The existential danger to the nation is when the policymaker corrupts the role of the intelligence agencies, which is to provide unbiased and apolitical intelligence to inform policy.”","author":"EILEEN SULLIVAN","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/us/politics/trump-intelligence.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-01-30 19:43:00+00:00","published_utc":1548895380,"collection_utc":1567550256,"_deepnote_index_column":8},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-01-30--Foxconn Is Reconsidering Plan for Manufacturing in Wisconsin","date":"2019-01-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Foxconn Is Reconsidering Plan for Manufacturing in Wisconsin","content":"The lawmakers added: “The company is reacting to the wave of economic uncertainty that the new governor has brought with his administration.”\n\nThe plans for the plant — including what it would produce, and the composition of its work force — have changed over time.

This year, the company is eligible for a jobs-related credit if it creates at least 520 full-time jobs, and an investment credit that can be scaled back if job creation falls short.\n\nMr. Bartik said Foxconn had been vague about whether the promise of 13,000 jobs refers solely to those created by the company or includes related jobs among retailers or along the supply chain. Foxconn, for example, has said that each job it creates will generate 2.7 jobs down the line.

Blood arrived at Afghanistan’s government headquarters, summoned by the new president, whose ousted predecessor had just been smothered to death with a pillow.\n\nWhile the Kabul government was a client of the Soviet Union, the new president, Hafizullah Amin, had something else in mind. “I think he wants an improvement in U.S.-Afghan relations,” Mr. Blood wrote in a cable back to Washington. It was possible, he added, that Mr. Amin wanted “a long-range hedge against over-dependence on the Soviet Union.”\n\nMr. Blood’s newly published cable sheds light on what really drove the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan only two months after his meeting with Mr. Amin. Spoiler alert: It was not because of terrorism, as claimed this month by President Trump, who said the Soviets were right to invade. Among the real motivations, the cable and other documents suggest, was a fear that Afghanistan might switch loyalties to the West.\n\n“This was a key moment that raised the Soviet sense of threat,” said Thomas S. Blanton, the director of the National Security Archive, a research organization at George Washington University that recently obtained the cable through the Freedom of Information Act and posted it online on Tuesday. “It’s a fascinating case study of the necessity in all of these international affairs of putting yourself in the other guy’s place — what does it look like over there?”","author":"PETER BAKER","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/afghanistan-trump-soviet-union.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-01-30 00:17:51+00:00","published_utc":1548825471,"collection_utc":1567550256,"_deepnote_index_column":10},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-01-30--Huawei and China Facing US Charges Have Few Ways to Retaliate","date":"2019-01-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Huawei and China, Facing U.S. Charges, Have Few Ways to Retaliate","content":"The broad language of the Justice Department’s indictments suggests that other Huawei leaders, including Mr. Ren, a former officer in the People’s Liberation Army, might wish to exercise caution while traveling to countries that have an extradition treaty with the United States.\n\n“If I was his lawyer, I would advise him to be careful,” said Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University.\n\nBut that kind of caution could make it harder still for Huawei to hold on to its business in places like Europe.

Says","content":"Though Venezuelan generals appear to be backing Mr. Maduro, a handful of Venezuelan diplomats and officials posted to missions in the United States have said they are abandoning the Maduro government to support Mr. Guaidó. On Monday, Scarlett Salazar, a veteran diplomat based in Miami, where there is a large anti-Maduro Venezuelan population, announced she was siding with Mr. Guaidó.\n\nMost Latin American countries have recognized Mr. Guaidó and demanded that Mr. Maduro acquiesce to the call for new elections. Several European nations also joined the call for elections after Mr. Pompeo held a meeting with representatives of the United Nations Security Council in New York on Saturday.\n\nThe campaign by the Trump administration has gotten a high level of bipartisan support among lawmakers in Washington, though some Democratic legislators have expressed concern about how hard-line policies might affect ordinary Venezuelans, who are already suffering from years of economic collapse. Others have asked whether the administration has a coherent strategy if Mr. Maduro clings to power.\n\nOn Monday, the United States put into effect what is essentially an embargo on oil from the main Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa. The sanctions would prevent most American companies from doing business with Pdvsa. Any money going to Pdvsa — including from its United States subsidiary, Citgo — would be put into accounts that could be used by what the Trump administration deems to be the legitimate Venezuelan government. For now, that is Mr. Guaidó and the National Assembly, where the 35-year-old political activist and industrial engineer serves as leader.\n\nThe oil sanctions amount to the first punitive action taken by the United States against Mr. Maduro since the power struggle in Caracas erupted last week, and it is intended to starve the government of Mr. Maduro of cash and foreign currency. Oil production in Venezuela has already plummeted because of mismanagement and poor policies, and the country’s economy is in shambles. Extraction at oil fields still takes place, though, and until now the country exported much of its crude oil to the United States to be refined and then sold.\n\nVenezuela also uses its oil to pay off debt held by China and Russia, and it does not get cash in return for those exports. Russia has denounced United States policy on Venezuela, while China has expressed concern but been more circumspect.","author":"EDWARD WONG","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/us/politics/venezuela-bank-accounts-guaido-pompeo.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-01-30 00:05:52+00:00","published_utc":1548824752,"collection_utc":1567550256,"_deepnote_index_column":14},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-01-30--News Analysis A Growing Chorus of Republican Critics for Trumps Foreign Policy","date":"2019-01-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"News Analysis: A Growing Chorus of Republican Critics for Trump’s Foreign Policy","content":"“There’s no dearth of evidence of the disconnect between the president and Republican orthodoxy,” said Mr. Edelman, a longstanding critic of Mr. Trump. But Mr. Edelman noted that the disagreement has been rooted in Congress. “As you look at the Republican Party in the electorate, I think it’s lining up a little more with the president because I think he’s shifting Republican voters more on things like trade and Russia, maybe on Syria and Afghanistan.”\n\nIndeed, many of Mr. Trump’s supporters have cheered his more protectionist stance on trade and the tariff wars with China as well as American allies. Likewise, many Trump supporters have grown weary of overseas military ventures that never seem to end and therefore applaud his moves to bring home American troops. Polls have even detected a shift in Republican views on Russia, which throughout the Cold War was a unifying force in the party.\n\nIn Republican circles in Washington, however, the unease coincides with a critical juncture in Mr. Trump’s foreign policy. His pullouts from Syria and Afghanistan come as trade talks with China head toward a climactic deadline and Mr. Trump prepares to get together next month with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, for their second summit meeting after an initial encounter in Singapore last year.\n\nOlivia Enos, a policy scholar on Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said doubts had grown about Mr. Trump’s negotiations with North Korea to eliminate its nuclear program.\n\n“Many initially welcomed the president’s pursuit of diplomacy in North Korea,” she said. “But after Singapore, many questioned whether North Korea was sincere in coming to the negotiating table. Since that time, North Korea has continued to play hard to get, calling its sincerity to denuclearize into further question.”\n\nSome analysts said it was the way Mr. Trump makes his decisions as much as the decisions themselves that rattle the foreign policy establishment. Announcing the Syria pullout by Twitter without preparing the allies or framing the public explanations left even some of the president’s strongest supporters in Washington unnerved.\n\n“I don’t think Leader McConnell or anyone else wants to take the wheel from the president or even give him rudder direction,” said Frederic C. Hof, a former State Department official who worked on Syria and is now diplomat in residence at Bard College. “They want to be sure he’s at the helm and he knows he has a crew.

Rules","content":"Critics fear that private health care, which tends to have higher costs than government-provided care, will force the department to cut corners elsewhere. Mr. Trump has instructed his cabinet secretaries to cut each department’s budget, and a prior budget agreement that lifted caps on spending is set to expire soon, leading many to wonder if Veterans Affairs will be able to pay private providers and maintain its own services.\n\nA congressionally mandated report in 2016, by a panel called the Commission on Care, analyzed the cost of sending more veterans into the community for treatment and warned that unfettered access could cost well over $100 billion each year. That same commission found quality of care at the Department of Veterans Affairs to be very high, one area of agreement between department officials and those who use and advocate the system.\n\nThe new standards were developed after V.A. officials studied both the military’s insurance plan, Tricare Prime, which sets a lower bar for access to private care than the department has historically had, and the Medicare Advantage program, which allows Medicare beneficiaries to buy private health insurance plans instead of using government-run fee-for-service Medicare.\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs will remain at the center of care coordination, and the private providers — who would be paid by the department at rates roughly comparable to the Medicare program — would not be permitted to cherry-pick the healthiest patients, V.A. officials said. About 26 percent of veterans pay a co-payment, and they would have similar co-payments at private doctors.\n\nThe department, however, has struggled greatly with its information technology systems in recent years, and studying those systems is now the purview of a House subcommittee. Whether the department can successfully coordinate care with myriad health care providers will be a concern that Congress will doubtlessly follow.\n\nDepartment officials — including Mr. Wilkie — have repeatedly insisted that the department should and probably will remain the provider of choice for most veterans, who prefer the culture of a V.A. hospital to that of the private sector. But a shrinking veteran population over all in the United States and more reliance on private providers could lead to the closings of some government hospitals, some veterans groups and members of Congress warn.\n\nMr. Wilkie insisted that was not the goal of the new policy, and said that fears of full privatization were unfounded.","author":"JENNIFER STEINHAUER","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/us/politics/veterans-health-care.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-01-30 21:26:55+00:00","published_utc":1548901615,"collection_utc":1567550256,"_deepnote_index_column":18},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-07-24--On Politics Mueller Time","date":"2019-07-24","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"On Politics: Mueller Time","content":"Good Wednesday morning.

Mr. Zebley, 49, was to help Mr. Mueller answer questions about the sprawling investigation and the 448-page report documenting it, a committee official familiar with the hearing said.\n\nThe news prompted President Trump to post a series of accusations about Mr. Zebley, including that he is a “Never Trumper” lawyer, a reference to prosecutors on Mr. Mueller’s team he believes were opposed to him.

When Robert S. Mueller III takes the oath on Wednesday morning in the wood-paneled Room 2141 of the Rayburn House Office Building, he will answer questions for the first time since opening his special counsel investigation into President Trump and Russia more than two years ago.\n\nBut for all the anticipation, for all the fighting that it took to get to this day, many in Washington assume it will be more fizzle than sizzle.

This also turned out to be a source of confusion. While plenty of blame can be directed at Congress for designing a confusing program and at loan servicers for carrying out the program poorly, the truth is that many of the applicants hadn’t been public servants for all of the previous decade.\n\nWhy, then, does the Congressional Budget Office keep raising its estimated cost of the forgiveness program? The numbers are startling. In 2016, the C.B.O. estimated the annual cost of providing graduate school loans to be $4 billion. The next year it revised it to $6 billion. Last year the number jumped to $8 billion. This year, it’s up to $12 billion — all because the C.B.O. keeps increasing its estimate of how many public service loans the government will eventually write off.\n\nIn part, it’s simply a matter of time. If you thought you made 120 qualifying payments, but really only made 110, you can make 10 more and apply again. Some of the people initially rejected will have their loans forgiven this year or next. Future applicants will need to be less immaculate as time goes on. Servicers may get better at their job.\n\nBut the other big reason for the rising price is that lawmakers weren’t done tinkering with student loans back in 2007. Far from it. They continued to add and adjust, each time making the program more complicated and expensive.\n\nThe first big change came in 2010, when Congress got rid of the subsidized private bank loan program. All new loans would be Direct Loans — and thus, eligible for the forgiveness program. At the same time, Congress made the forgiveness program much more generous, by reducing monthly loan payments under income-based repayment to 10 percent of discretionary income, from 15 percent.\n\nCongress never gets rid of old ways to repay student loans. It just creates new ones. The 2007 law created what we’ll call Old I.B.R (Income-Based Repayment), in which you pay 15 percent of income. The 2010 law created New I.B.R., in which you pay 10 percent. New I.B.R. wasn’t supposed to be available until 2014. But some clever Obama administration lawyers figured out how to create another repayment option out of whole regulatory cloth that mirrored New I.B.R but was available sooner.","author":"Kevin Carey","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/upshot/student-debt-forgiveness-already-happening.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"2019-07-24 13:15:41+00:00","published_utc":1563988541,"collection_utc":1567535968,"_deepnote_index_column":30},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-07-24--Barr Revives Encryption Debate Calling on Tech Firms to Allow for Law Enforcement","date":"2019-07-24","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Barr Revives Encryption Debate, Calling on Tech Firms to Allow for Law Enforcement","content":"Mr. Barr also said that companies that sell encryption with the goal of ensuring “that law enforcement will not be able to gain lawful access” are “illegitimate.”\n\nMr. Barr’s position echoed that of former Justice Department officials, including James B.

Some states allow food stamps for people with incomes as high as 200 percent of the poverty line.\n\nThe new rule would make it much harder for people above those asset limits and income levels to qualify.\n\nUnder the proposed rule, families with assets or income above the limits would be eligible for food stamps only if they had been receiving any kind of help under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program for more than six months. The new rule would restrict the kind of noncash assistance received under the program that qualifies families for food stamps: They would be eligible if they were receiving aid like job training and child care help. The idea behind the requirement, agriculture officials said, was that it would help demonstrate which families were truly in need of help and weed out fraud.\n\nExperts countered that the new rule would cut off families most in need of support. “It’s exactly the kinds of households that the administration is interested in supporting,” said Elaine Waxman, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute.\n\nDemocrats view the proposed rule as another attempt to dismantle the food stamp program.

Conservatives had also hoped to close a loophole that allows states to waive the requirements in areas with high unemployment.\n\n“This proposal is yet another attempt by this administration to circumvent Congress and make harmful changes to nutrition assistance that have been repeatedly rejected on a bipartisan basis,” Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, said in a statement.\n\nThere will be a 60-day public comment period before the Agriculture Department can move forward with the rule.","author":"Lola Fadulu","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/us/politics/trump-food-stamps.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"2019-07-24 00:32:27+00:00","published_utc":1563942747,"collection_utc":1567535968,"_deepnote_index_column":35},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-04-07--Cory Booker Raises 5 Million in First Quarter of 2020 Race","date":"2019-04-07","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Cory Booker Raises $5 Million in First Quarter of 2020 Race","content":"[Here’s a look at “baby bonds,” a signature proposal of Mr. Booker’s campaign.]\n\nMr. Booker declined to disclose how many people had contributed to his campaign or the number of contributions he received.

Many of the presidential candidates are on record opposing capital punishment; Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president who is expected to enter the race in the coming weeks, has supported it.\n\nAs a senator in the 1990s, Mr. Biden supported many get-tough-on-crime policies that liberals now disavow, including limits on appeals for death row inmates.\n\n“Biden was one of the major proponents of the 1994 amendments that severely limited the ability of death row prisoners to obtain meaningful judicial review,” said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit group that provides analysis and information on capital punishment. “Other people who have sponsored that bill have said they thought that was a mistake. And I think that voters will have to decide whether candidates for office have made mistakes and learned from them, or whether they are professing new views because the views of the public have changed.”\n\nWhile Ms. Harris has long opposed capital punishment, she has a somewhat complicated history on the issue. As the district attorney in San Francisco, she refused to seek a death sentence for a defendant accused of murdering a police officer, provoking outrage from the right. But she defended California’s death penalty as the state’s attorney general, and twice, in 2012 and 2016, she refused to take a stand on ballot initiatives that proposed to abolish it.\n\nAside from Mr. Biden, most of the other candidates have opposed the death penalty. In addition to Ms. Harris and Mr. O’Rourke, who have said they would support a federal moratorium, Senators Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren and Kirsten Gillibrand all said they support Mr. Newsom’s moratorium. Two former governors in the race — John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Jay Inslee of Washington — imposed moratoriums in their states.\n\n“It’s kind of interesting that they are talking about it because it had pretty much dropped off the radar for national campaigns,” said Kent Scheidegger, the legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a group based in Sacramento that has led campaigns in California and across the country in support of the death penalty. “I’d love to see it made an issue.”","author":"TIM ARANGO","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/07/us/politics/death-penalty-democrats.html?partner=rss&emc=rss","published":"2019-04-07 14:30:05+00:00","published_utc":1554661805,"collection_utc":1567543692,"_deepnote_index_column":42},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-04-07--House Democratic Campaign Arm Nears War With Liberals Over Primary Fights","date":"2019-04-07","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"House Democratic Campaign Arm Nears War With Liberals Over Primary Fights","content":"WASHINGTON — The House Democratic campaign arm is nearing open warfare with the party’s rising liberal wing as political operatives close to Speaker Nancy Pelosi try to shut down primary challenges before what is likely to be a hard-fought campaign next year to preserve the party’s shaky majority.\n\nProgressive Democrats were infuriated last month when Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, moved to protect centrist incumbents by formally breaking committee business ties with political consultants and pollsters who go to work for primary challengers.\n\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, who owes her seat to a successful primary challenge, went so far as to encourage her 3.8 million Twitter followers to “pause” their donations to the campaign committee in protest. She also started a fund-raising push on her official Twitter account for Representatives Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Katie Hill of California and Mike Levin of California. That initiative, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said on Twitter, raised $30,000 in roughly two hours. She also helped raise money for Representatives Katie Porter of California and Lauren Underwood of Illinois.\n\nThe open hostilities are just the latest in the rising tensions between an experienced party establishment focusing on what is possible in the short run and a group of young liberals chafing at such restraint. House Democrats have divided over single-payer “Medicare for all” versus incremental legislation to bolster the Affordable Care Act and over Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal versus less ambitious climate change policies.

But in three months as attorney general, he has aligned himself with the president’s dim view of the inquiry. He declined to knock down the notion that the Russia investigation was a witch hunt, described investigative efforts into the Trump campaign as “spying” and begun the multiagency review into the roots of the investigation. Mr. Barr decided that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Mr. Trump for obstruction of justice, a decision that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, declined to make.\n\nMr. Barr served as a driving force in securing the power to declassify government secrets, and the lead-up to Thursday’s announcement demonstrated an amount of planning that went beyond previous similar forays by Mr. Trump and his aides. In July, when they announced that they planned to take away the security clearance of the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey, they had not done the homework to discover he no longer had one.\n\nMr. Barr asked for the White House to grant him additional, far-reaching powers for his review, according to two administration officials. The White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, who was an assistant to Mr. Barr during his first stint as attorney general under President George Bush in the early 1990s, oversaw the effort to grant Mr. Barr’s request, the officials said.\n\nAnd though the White House was ready last week to release the memo outlining his new powers, Mr. Barr asked for the White House to wait until he had taken care of outstanding business, including telling the heads of all the relevant intelligence agencies about the coming change.\n\nWhen the White House released the memo on Thursday evening, it landed with authority and a presentation that signaled a concerted effort unlike Mr. Trump’s tweets or stream-of-consciousness comments to reporters. The document was written in legalese and issued as a memorandum on White House letterhead.\n\nFor Democrats, Mr. Barr’s newfound powers served as a sign that Mr. Trump had found a new, and potentially effective, tool in his war on the so-called deep state.\n\n“This is a president who will lash out and destroy anything if he believes it will suit his interests,” said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “And he now has a capable lieutenant in the attorney general to help him do just that.”","author":"Michael S.

And if the overall economic numbers remain strong, the Democratic nominee will be looking for a pathway to defeat Mr. Trump that is distinctly different from those taken the last two times an incumbent president lost. Historically, when a president seeks re-election, it amounts to a referendum on the state of the economy.\n\nThe last two one-term presidents were undone by economic slowdowns; they battled jobless rates of 7.4 percent (George H.W. Bush) and 7.5 percent (Jimmy Carter) on Election Day. The unemployment rate currently stands at 3.6 percent.\n\nMoreover, voters appear to be more positive about the economy than they have been in many years. In polling by Gallup this spring, the share of Americans who described the economy as “excellent” hovered near its highest levels since 2000, and only 13 percent of Americans mentioned economic issues as the nation’s most important problem.\n\nThat helps explain why the candidates are avoiding frontal assaults on the economy. Most prefer to change the subject to longer-term problems than to get wrapped up in debates over the Obama economic record or budget deficits.\n\n“The challenge that Trump could run into in 2020 is that people don’t measure the quality of their economic life in the jobs numbers they see,” said Jacob Leibenluft, who worked in the Obama White House and was a senior policy adviser on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign. “If you look at what Trump has done from a policy perspective, there’s very little to suggest that he’s addressed the acute problems that people feel in their economic lives.”\n\nIndeed, Democratic base voters — like those who showed up at campaign events recently in New Hampshire — tend to latch onto problems deeper than what macroeconomists normally talk about when evaluating the economy.","author":"Neil Irwin","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/26/upshot/2020-democrats-economy-challenging-trump.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"2019-05-26 16:07:22+00:00","published_utc":1558901242,"collection_utc":1567540165,"_deepnote_index_column":49}],"rows_bottom":[{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-25--How Bernie Sanders Learned to Love Campaigning in California","date":"2019-12-25","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"How Bernie Sanders Learned to Love Campaigning in California","content":"The public events for Mr. Buttigieg were designed to show him being introduced to Latino voters and listening to their concerns.

They will vote for Joe Biden and that’s how he wins this next election.”\n\nIn recent days, Mr. Biden has been sharpening the contrast between himself and his Democratic rivals, using an addition to his stump speech to swipe at those who suggest that he is “naïve” for wanting to cooperate with Republicans — the very Republicans, he acknowledges, who are attacking him, his family and his “only living son.”\n\nOn Friday, a reporter asked Mr. Biden for evidence that Republican officials and voters had any interest in working with him.","author":"Katie Glueck","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/25/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-republicans.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Wed, 25 Dec 2019 22:10:11 +0000","published_utc":1577329811,"collection_utc":1577319219,"_deepnote_index_column":6461},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-25--For Trump Organization, Office Skyscrapers Make Up for Lagging Hotels","date":"2019-12-25","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"For Trump Organization, Office Skyscrapers Make Up for Lagging Hotels","content":"DORAL, Fla. — It is happy hour at Trump National Doral Miami, the sprawling resort that is the biggest cash generator in President Trump’s business portfolio.

We didn’t,” William B. Roper, the head of Air Force acquisitions and technology, said on Friday. “Every service now has a major hypersonics program in a departmentwide effort to catch up.”\n\nThe United States Air Force has two hypersonic prototypes in testing and while development is on an accelerated pace, the weapons are not scheduled to be operational until 2022. Other parts of the Pentagon, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, have other hypersonic initiatives, but they are many years down the road.\n\nStill, experts say the threat to the United States appears limited. Russia’s system is being deployed in relatively low numbers, likely no more than a couple of dozen, according to Daryl G. Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association. As a result, the system “does not significantly increase the threat to the United States and the world” of Russia’s already fearsome nuclear arsenal, Mr. Kimball said.\n\nBut he said the two countries should discuss hypersonics as part of any new treaty negotiations.\n\n“Washington and Moscow should immediately commence talks on how new weapons technologies and all types of nuclear weapons should be regulated so that neither side believes they can gain an advantage by ‘racing’ ahead of the other,” Mr. Kimball said.\n\nThe Russian weapon — known as a hypersonic glide vehicle — can fly lower in the atmosphere, avoiding ballistic missile defense radars. It is mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile, allowing the warhead to be initially carried toward a target on a traditional piece of technology. But as it gets closer to the target, it is designed to fly at hypersonic speeds in an unpredictable path — making detection, tracking and interception extremely difficult. Most American missile defenses work by predicting the path of an incoming weapon, and shooting an “interceptor” at it.\n\nOn Friday, Russia’s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, informed Mr. Putin that the first missile regiment armed with the glide vehicle was operational, the ministry said in a statement. The strategic missile forces chief, Gen. Sergei Karakayev, said at a meeting later in the day that the new missile was deployed with a military unit in the town of Yasny of the Orenburg region on the border with Kazakhstan.\n\nThe Pentagon declined to comment on the Russian statement, but other American officials said there was no reason to doubt Moscow had deployed the new weapon.","author":"Julian E.

So who is he? Bloomberg grew up outside of Boston. After college and Harvard Business School, he got into investment banking. In the 1980s, he created the Bloomberg Terminal, a financial tool for investors that would make him a billionaire. And in 2001, Bloomberg ran for mayor of New York City as a Republican. “That should make a great politician.” Then in the middle of his campaign, New York City changed forever on Sept. 11. As New York’s outgoing mayor took the national stage, he gave Bloomberg the thumbs up. “Well, I’m urging people to vote for Mike Bloomberg.” “I, Michael R. Bloomberg —” Bloomberg won. One of his priorities as mayor was tackling public health. “Sixty-four ounce. Just think about that.” “Don’t go near these things.” He also pushed for controversial stop-and-frisk policies that disproportionately affected minority communities. “Everything the New York City Police Department has done is absolutely —is legal.” But just days before entering the presidential race this year, he apologized. “I just want you to know that I realize back then, I was wrong.” In 2007, he left the G.O.P. And in 2008, during the financial crisis, he asked the City Council to extend term limits in order to let him run for a controversial third term. “Yes.” “No.” “No.” “Aye.” “Aye.” The vote passed, and he won re-election. “We’re going to make the next four years the best yet.” So what about the issues? After he left office in 2013, Bloomberg went back to running his company, which includes a news division. But he’s also focused on supporting candidates … “Let’s elect a sane, competent person.” … and causes he cares about, many of which are now key parts of his platform. Bloomberg is a vocal supporter of gun reform. “We cannot have a society where you go out in the street, and you can get blown away. We just have to say enough is enough.” He also has big plans for health care reform and fighting climate change. “Trump has done us a favor. Every time he riles against climate change, the money comes flooding in.” Overall, Bloomberg is positioning himself as a moderate in the Democratic field. “With the right candidate, we can turn areas from red to blue.” So what about his chances? They’re somewhat unknown. As a billionaire and fellow New Yorker, Bloomberg supporters feel he is uniquely positioned to take on President Trump. “I’m a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.” “There is nobody I’d rather run against than ‘Little Michael.’ That I can tell you.” But he has challenges ahead. He’s as not well known outside of New York City. Also, Bloomberg probably won’t participate in any of the Democratic debates, and he’s likely to skip the early primaries and caucuses. His hope: to surge on Super Tuesday and chart a path to the nomination. “I am running for president to defeat Donald Trump, and to unite and rebuild America.”","author":"Jeremy W.

And to its many liberal and independent-leaning fans, in particular, it has become something more than just a nostalgic drama from a time when men’s suits with pleated pants is fashionable and Twitter does not yet exist. For many in the Trump era, the show is an idealistic alternative reality, an escape from the vitriol and ill-will that they see coursing like poison through contemporary politics.\n\nMuch as people may return to the film “It’s a Wonderful Life” to remind themselves that feeling worthless does not mean you have no worth, or to the children’s book “Goodnight Moon” to remember that bedtime once meant being enveloped in a cocoon of love, fans revisit “The West Wing” to recall an era — even a fictional one — when it seemed possible for the three branches of government to be populated by public servants of integrity, intellect and wit.\n\n“When I feel the need for comfort from the circus in the White House, I watch the pilot,” said Terry Callanan Kempf of Glens Falls, N.Y., who belongs to the Facebook group “Fans of West Wing Weekly Podcast,” whose members share a passion for revisiting the show. “Seriously, almost every night before I go to sleep.”\n\n“The West Wing” premiered two years into President Bill Clinton’s second term in office, but the bulk of it was broadcast during President George W. Bush’s administration. The partisan divide was bad then, but it was not nearly so awful — so personal, so vicious, so apocalyptic, so apparently beyond redemption — as it appears to many people now.\n\nBradley Whitford, the actor who played Josh Lyman, the deputy White House chief of staff, has called the show “liberal porn,” and that is true, in a way. Its president, Josiah Bartlet, is a progressive Democrat whose policies run firmly to the left. Erudite, articulate, empathetic, able to speak Latin and quote the Bible, inclined to give people the benefit of the doubt, he seems almost painfully distant from many American presidents (some perhaps more than others).","author":"Sarah Lyall","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/us/politics/west-wing-politics.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 08:00:07 +0000","published_utc":1577624407,"collection_utc":1577621618,"_deepnote_index_column":6492},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-29--Biden, Reversing Position, Says He Would Comply With Impeachment Subpoena","date":"2019-12-29","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Biden, Reversing Position, Says He Would Comply With Impeachment Subpoena","content":"FAIRFIELD, Iowa — Joseph R.

At the same time, the effort to win a commitment from the Ukrainians for the investigations sought by Mr. Trump was intensifying, with Mr. Giuliani and a Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, meeting in Madrid on Aug. 2 and the diplomats Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker also working the issue.\n\nAnd inside the intelligence community, a C.I.A. officer was hearing talk about the two strands of pressure on Ukraine, including the aid freeze. Seeing how they fit together, he was alarmed enough that by Aug. 12 he would take the extraordinary step of laying them out in detail in a confidential whistle-blower complaint.\n\nKeeping a hold on the assistance was now a top priority, so officials moved to tighten control over the money.\n\nIn a very unusual step, the White House removed Mr. Sandy’s authority to oversee the aid freeze. The job was handed in late July to Mr. Sandy’s boss, Mr. Duffey, the political appointee, the official ultimately responsible for apportionments but one who had little experience in the nuts and bolts of the budget office process.\n\nAs the debate over the aid continued, disagreements flared. Two budget office staff members left the agency after the summer. Mr. Sandy testified that their departures were related to the aid freeze, a statement disputed by budget office officials.\n\nPentagon officials, in the dark about the reason for the holdup, grew increasingly frustrated. Ms. McCusker, the powerful Pentagon budget official, notified the budget office that either $61 million of the money would have to be spent by Monday, Aug. 12 or it would be lost. The budget office saw her threat as a ploy to force release of the aid.\n\nAt the White House, which had been looped into the dispute by the budget office, there was a growing consensus that officials could find a legal rationale for continuing the hold, but with the Monday deadline looming, it was a “POTUS-level decision,” one official said.","author":"Eric Lipton, Maggie Haberman and Mark Mazzetti","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/us/politics/trump-ukraine-military-aid.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Sun, 29 Dec 2019 22:19:49 +0000","published_utc":1577675989,"collection_utc":1577665091,"_deepnote_index_column":6495},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-30--U.S. Launches Attacks on Iranian-Backed Forces in Iraq and Syria","date":"2019-12-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"U.S. Launches Attacks on Iranian-Backed Forces in Iraq and Syria","content":"The ammunition facilities held both rockets and drones used by Kataib Hezbollah.

Mr. Lewis said that while he was “cleareyed about the prognosis,” doctors had told him that advances in medical treatment would help give him “a fighting chance.”\n\n“I have decided to do what I know to do and do what I have always done: I am going to fight it and keep fighting for the beloved community,” Mr. Lewis said. “We still have many bridges to cross.”","author":"Emily Cochrane","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/us/politics/rep-john-lewis-pancreatic-cancer.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 02:23:33 +0000","published_utc":1577690613,"collection_utc":1577708076,"_deepnote_index_column":6502},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-30--U.S. Launches Airstrikes on Iranian-Backed Forces in Iraq and Syria","date":"2019-12-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"U.S. Launches Airstrikes on Iranian-Backed Forces in Iraq and Syria","content":"Experts say Tehran miscalculated that Mr. Trump’s desire to avoid war with Iran would restrain the American military if its forces were attacked. Kirsten Fontenrose, a former National Security Council official now with the Atlantic Council, said the current upheaval and protests in Iraq had allowed Iranian proxies to “operate unfettered.” Iran’s stepped-up activity convinced the United States that it needed to act.\n\n“We knew Iran would pursue a policy of continued low-level escalation with the U.S. and allies at least through the U.S. elections,” she said. “Iran knew that President Trump does not want an all-out war. Iran’s mistake was in assuming that U.S. strategic thinking would not adapt to conditions on the ground.”\n\nWhile Mr. Trump has sought to wind down the American war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, he has built up forces meant to deter against Iranian attacks. Trump administration officials have also said American forces were in Iraq to help counter Iranian influence in Iraq and the region.\n\nAs rocket attacks by Iranian proxies have increased in recent weeks, some Defense Department officials have been worried that the situation could escalate beyond the kind of shadow conflict that the United States and Iran have been engaged in.\n\nThe death of the American contractor and the response by the Pentagon could potentially lead to further escalation. Iran could respond with a renewed roadside bomb campaign or more powerful rocket and missile attacks, a move that would most likely result in a more aggressive response by the United States.\n\nAmerican military commanders have warned for months about a growing risk of attacks by Iranian proxy forces on American interests and forces in the region, as Tehran chafes against the Trump administration’s renewed economic sanctions and campaign to force it to renegotiate the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nSo far Iran and its proxies have mostly focused on American allies and partners. The United States has accused Iran of striking at oil tankers in the Arabian Sea and launching drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi oil facilities. Iran also shot down an American drone.","author":"Julian E.

In turn, Ms. Warren has been pressed about the $10 million she transferred to her presidential campaign from her 2018 Senate bid, when she was still courting such large contributors.\n\nBoth Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg recently did disclose their bundlers, with Mr. Buttigieg sharing the names of more than 100 people or couples who had gathered at least $25,000 and Mr. Biden disclosing more than 200. Mr. Biden appeared to time his release to minimize attention, revealing the names of his top fund-raisers late on the Friday evening after Christmas.\n\nMr. Biden has seen some of the bundlers for his former rivals who have left the race — especially Ms. Harris but also former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas — gravitate toward him as he continues to lead in national polling. Former Harris supporters now backing Mr. Biden include John Emerson, an investment executive in California; two influential New York finance-world fund-raisers, Marc Lasry and Blair Effron; and Alex Heckler, an attorney in Florida.","author":"Shane Goldmacher","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/us/politics/biden-warren-fundraising-democrats.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 19:35:03 +0000","published_utc":1577752503,"collection_utc":1577751303,"_deepnote_index_column":6504},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-30--A Biden-G.O.P.

But on Monday, he was asked a particularly provocative one: Would he consider choosing a Republican as his vice president?\n\n“The answer is I would, but I can’t think of one now,” Mr. Biden said at a town hall-style event in Exeter, N.H., drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\nMr. Biden then elaborated on what he meant. “There are some really decent Republicans that are out there still, but here’s the problem right now of the well-known ones: They’ve got to step up,” he said.\n\nMr. Biden has emphasized the need for a future Democratic president to work with Republicans, stressing the importance of consensus in order to get things done. That viewpoint has been criticized by some liberals who see it as an unacceptable embrace of the status quo and think Mr. Biden is naïve about trying to work with Republicans. But choosing a Republican to be his running mate would be a far more grievous act in the eyes of many Democrats, something many party officials and both liberal and moderate activists would oppose.","author":"Thomas Kaplan","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/30/us/politics/joe-biden-running-mate.html?emc=rss&partner=rss","published":"Mon, 30 Dec 2019 21:28:43 +0000","published_utc":1577759323,"collection_utc":1577751304,"_deepnote_index_column":6505},{"id":"thenewyorktimes--2019-12-30--Immigration Official Tweets, Then Deletes, Accusation Against Monsey Suspect","date":"2019-12-30","source":"thenewyorktimes","title":"Immigration Official Tweets, Then Deletes, Accusation Against Monsey Suspect","content":"Kenneth T.

While most of those were focused on groups like Al Qaeda and then the Islamic State, both with the reach to orchestrate or inspire attacks on the United States homeland, American military and intelligence agencies also built up resources against regional terrorism threats.\n\nThe Trump administration, hoping to prevent the United States from becoming entangled in more long wars, wants the military and intelligence forces to scale down their ambitions. Under the plans now being discussed, fewer resources would be allocated to monitoring regional threats — terrorist groups that might spout anti-American speech but do not have the wherewithal to mount a significant attack on United States territory.\n\nMr. Rasmussen said no terrorist organization in Africa so far had successfully been able to attack the American homeland, giving credence to the idea that too much emphasis had been put on such groups. But without military and intelligence personnel on the ground, working with partner nations to help combat regional terrorist organizations, it becomes difficult to assess which groups have or could have the capabilities to mount an attack on the United States, Mr. Rasmussen said.\n\n“If our intelligence picture is degraded significantly by a drawdown in presence, we run the risk of failing to collect that critical bit of intelligence that might give us insight on the capability part of the equation,” Mr. Rasmussen said.\n\nThe shift, military and intelligence officials said, is also part of an effort to move resources toward countering the rise of China and to more adroitly compete with Beijing.\n\nBut some American officials believe that cutting back the intelligence and military presence will reduce the United States’ clout in Africa at the very time it is becoming a front line in the influence battle with Russia and China.","author":"Julian E.
